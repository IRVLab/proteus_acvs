# proteus_acvs

This is the Autonomous Communication Vector Selection package for PROTEUS. 

If you want to change the weights of heuristic selections, look at the .yaml files in the /heuristics directory.
If you want to change the way that vectors are selected, look at the /scripts/acvs/policies directory. 

If you want to do other stuff, feel free to email Michael for help!
