# proteus_acvs

This is the Autonomous Communication Vector Selection package for PROTEUS. 

If you want to change the weights of heuristic selections, look at the .yaml files in the /heuristics directory.
If you want to change the way that vectors are selected, look at the /scripts/acvs/policies directory. 

If you want to do other stuff, feel free to email Michael for help!


### This is research code. As much as I would love to be able to develop it until it's extremely stable and easy to use, that's simply not the way that PhDs work. Please do your best to figure out what's going on inside this code, and if you have problems that you can't resolve, submit an issue/email Michael.
